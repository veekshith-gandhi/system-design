# üß† Understanding Abstract in Java

## What is "Abstract" in Java?

In the real world, **abstract** means something *not fully defined*‚Äîjust an idea or blueprint.

In **Java**, `abstract` is used to define a **base template** for classes and methods. You can't use it directly, but it tells other classes:  
*"Here's what you MUST implement."*

---

## üß± Key Concepts

### 1. Abstract Class

An abstract class:
- Cannot be instantiated (you can't create objects from it directly).
- Can contain:
    - Abstract methods (no body)
    - Concrete methods (fully defined)
    - Variables, constructors, etc.

```java
abstract class Animal {
    abstract void sound();      // Abstract method
    void sleep() {
        System.out.println("Sleeping...");
    }
}

```

### 2. Abstract Method
A method that is declared without implementation:
- Must be implemented in the child class.

```java
abstract void sound();
```

### 3. Why use Abstract Classes?

- You want to create a common template.
- You want to enforce rules on child classes (force them to implement specific methods).


# Abstract Classes Implementing Interfaces in Java

## ü§î What‚Äôs the Situation?

- You have an **interface** with method declarations.
- A class **implements** the interface.
- But if that class is **abstract**, you don‚Äôt have to override all the methods from the interface immediately.

Let‚Äôs understand **why** this works and **how** it plays out.

---

## üî∏ What is an Interface?

An interface is like a **contract** that says:

> Any class that *implements* me must provide code for all my methods.

```java
interface Animal {
    void makeSound();
}

class Dog implements Animal {
    // ‚ùå Compiler error if makeSound() is not implemented
}

abstract class Dog implements Animal {
    // ‚úÖ No compiler error even if makeSound() is not implemented
}


```

## ‚úÖ Why Abstract Classes Can Skip Method Implementation

- An abstract class is a class that is not complete. It acts like a blueprint and cannot be instantiated directly.
- By marking the class as abstract, you're telling the compiler:
- I know I haven‚Äôt implemented everything yet. I expect subclasses to complete it.
- Therefore, Java does not force you to implement all interface methods in an abstract class.

## üìå Key Points

1. Interfaces = 100% abstract by default.
2. Abstract classes can skip implementing interface methods.
3. Concrete classes must provide implementations.


# Understanding `static` in Abstract Classes - Java

## üî∏ Can Abstract Classes Have Static Members?

‚úÖ **Yes**, abstract classes can have:
- `static` variables
- `static` methods
- `static` blocks

Since abstract classes can't be instantiated directly, `static` members are useful for logic that belongs to the class itself, not any object.

---

## üí° Use Case of `static` in Abstract Class

Static methods are often utility methods or shared logic that subclasses can use without needing an instance.

### ‚úÖ Example:

```java
abstract class Shape {
    static int shapeCount = 0;

    static void printShapeInfo() {
        System.out.println("This is a shape class");
    }

    abstract double area();
}

Shape.printShapeInfo(); // Output: This is a shape class
System.out.println(Shape.shapeCount); // Output: 0

```

## üîπ Can You Use abstract static Methods?
- ‚ùå No, Java does not allow abstract static methods.

Why Not?

1. abstract means the method must be overridden in a subclass.
2. static means the method cannot be overridden, only hidden.

```java
abstract static void doSomething(); // ‚ùå Not allowed
```

##  You Use final static in Abstract Classes to declare constants

```java
abstract class Shape {
    public static final double PI = 3.14159;
}
```

# üß† Abstract Class vs Interface in Java

Java provides two ways to achieve abstraction: **Abstract Classes** and **Interfaces**. Each has its own strengths and use cases.

| **Default Method Implementation**  | ‚úÖ Yes, can have method bodies                 | ‚úÖ Yes (from Java 8 onwards)                   |
| **Constructor**                    | ‚úÖ Yes                                         | ‚ùå No                                          |
| **Access Modifiers**               | Can use public, protected, private            | Methods are implicitly `public abstract` (except static/default) |
| **Variables**                      | Instance or static variables                  | Only static `final` constants                 |
| **Type of Methods Allowed**        | Abstract and concrete                         | Abstract, default, static, and private methods (from Java 9) |
| **Use Case**                       | When classes share common behavior            | When unrelated classes need to follow a contract |
| **Performance**                    | Slightly faster (due to method body presence) | Interface calls may be slower (resolved at runtime) |

## ‚úÖ When to Use What?

### Use **Abstract Class** when:
- You want to share code among related classes.
- You expect future extensions with default behavior.
- You need fields or constructors.

### Use **Interface** when:
- You need to define a contract for behavior.
- You want to support multiple inheritance.
- You are building plug-and-play architecture or APIs.
