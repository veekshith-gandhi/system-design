### The .iml file stands for IntelliJ Module Library. It's a configuration file used by JetBrains IDEs like IntelliJ IDEA, WebStorm, PyCharm, etc.

### ðŸ§  Should you commit .iml to Git? Usually NO, because:
- âœ… It's IDE-specific (JetBrains only)
- âœ… Other developers might use different editors or setups
- âœ… It can change frequently with small local changes
- âœ… It adds clutter to version control

### ðŸ“„ What is .iml?
- It stores module-specific configuration.
- Module SDK (Java, Node.js, etc.)
- Module libraries and dependencies
- Source/resource/test folders

### So, .iml is purely for IDE internal management, not your applicationâ€™s functionality.
